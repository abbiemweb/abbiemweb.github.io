# This is a blog of everything I learned about python in computational biology.

## Python and R can work together!
```{R}
library(reticulate)

hi <- "Hello,"
```
## Reticulate allows for R and Python to work together. We will see how below. 

```{python}
hi = "my name is Abbie!"
print(r.hi, hi)
```

# We can also use python to do simple math.
```{python}
3-2
3**2 #3 squared
pow(3,2) #3 to the power of 2

3//2 #floor division
3/2
```

# This is how assignment works in python:
```{python}
eight = 8
nine = 9
two = 2
eight*nine
#multiple assignment works like this:
one, ten = nine-8, eight+two
one
ten
```

# Here is how we can build a sequence:
```{python}
x = list(range(2, 10, 1))
len(x)
max(x)
min(x)
type(x) #tells us what x is -- it's a list
```

# This is how you can index in python:
```{python}
list1 = [6,7,8,9]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'i', 'e']
list2[1] #python recognizes the 0th position. So, in list2, the first position is b and the 0th position is a.
list1[3]
list2[-1] #this asks to give the last element because -0 = 0. SO negative indexes start at 1.
```

# Slicing: We are slicing between elements.
```{python}
list1 = [6,7,8,9]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'i', 'e']

list2[1:] #gives elements after index 1
list2[1:4] #elements from index 1 to and not including 4
list2[-3:] #lists third from end to the end
list2[::2] #every other element
list1[3] = 99 #how to assign positions in a list
list1
list1.insert(4,100)
list1
```

# Other functions:
```{python}
list1.append(200) #adds this number to the end

list1.sort() #orders from least to greatest
list1

list1.reverse() #reverses the order
list1

list3 = list1 + list2 #combines both of the lists
list3
list3[7]

list4=[list1,list2] #nest the functions
list4
list4[1] #gives all of list 2
```

# In python, arithmetic is not vecotrized by default.
```{python}
for i in list1:
    print(i+1)
    
for i in range(len(list1)):
    print(list1[i]+1)
```


# How to save your output:
```{python}
plus1 = [] #makes empty list
for i in range(len(list1)):
    plus1.append(list1[i]+1)
plus1
```

# Special functions! Numpy uses arrays:
```{python}
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1,2,3])
x

print(x/2+1) #how to do math with arrays
x.shape #gives the size of the array

#we can also make a matrix
mat1= np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
mat1
mat1[0,0] #first element in mat1
mat1[:,0] #gives the first column
print(np.sum(mat1)) #sums up all elements
mat1.T #transpose


iden = np.eye(2)
iden
print(np.dot(iden, mat1)) #how to matrix multiply
print(iden*mat1) #scalar multiplication
```

# How to save output:
```{python}
plus1 = [] #makes empty list
for i in range(len(list1)):
    plus1.append(list1[i]+1)
plus1
```
# This is just a small list of everything that I have learned how to do in python! Please enjoy this picture of my puppy niece, Molly!
